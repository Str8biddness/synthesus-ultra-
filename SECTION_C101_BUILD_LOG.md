# C-101 — LLM Mounted as CGPU Surface ("The Merge") — Build Log

**Callout:** C-101 (integration; advances C-202 grounding + C-301 critic) · **Owner:** Claude (Opus 4.8) · **Date:** 2026-06-30
**Status:** ✅ tolerance MET — **PENDING REVIEW GATE** (Law #8: author does not self-approve)
**Built on:** Section B (C-201, verified) commit `869d4e8`, in isolated worktree `feat/c101-llm-cgpu` (Law #9).

## What this is
The merge. The Ollama-backed `LLMGenerationDevice` (C-201) is mounted as the CGPU
**surface realizer**, replacing the seed-passthrough bootstrap in `SurfaceRealizer`
(whose own TODO asked for exactly this). The LLM becomes the language cortex *inside*
the Quad Brain — grounding + critic still wrap every candidate. The LLM is a mounted
device, never the unbounded source of truth.

## Seam
`CGPURenderer(realizer=LLMSurfaceRealizer())`. `_render_candidate` already routes text
through `self.realizer.realize(...)` and then `self.critic.critique(...)`, so injecting
the LLM realizer keeps grounding + critic in the loop for free.

## Proof (C-101 DoD — real run output)
```
device      : chal://cgpu/render
LLM text    : '"...there's one giant that stands out from the rest - Jupiter.
               And trust me, this gas giant is..."'
diagnostics : {'source': 'llm_device', 'latency_ms': '5872'}   # real device, not seed, not degraded
critic      : accept | accepted: True
C-101 PROOF PASSED ✅  (LLM rendered, grounded, critic-judged)
```
Reproduce: `PYTHONPATH=".:packages/reasoning:packages/kernel:packages/knowledge:packages/core:packages" ./.venv/bin/python verify_c101.py` (requires local Ollama + `llama3.2:3b`).

## Files (this branch)
- **NEW** `packages/reasoning/generation/llm_realizer.py` — `LLMSurfaceRealizer`. On device error → degrades LOUDLY to seed + records reason (Law #5); never fabricates (Law #1).
- **NEW** `verify_c101.py` — the integration proof (real Ollama; not a CI unit test).
- **MOD** `packages/reasoning/generation/spine.py` — `from ..geometric_interference` → `from geometric_interference` (flat import works under every convention). *Packaging-chain fix (Section A concern) hit during integration.*
- **MOD** `packages/core/__init__.py` — top-level exports made **lazy** (PEP 562) so importing a lightweight device no longer force-loads the entire heavy runtime. *Decoupling fix.*

## Follow-ups (not in this PR)
- Wire `LLMSurfaceRealizer` as the runtime's **default** CGPU renderer (in `synth_runtime`/hemisphere quad-brain construction — Section A lane).
- Rebase onto latest `main` (this branch is off `869d4e8`, before the hardware-doc commits).
- The two packaging fixes should be reviewed by Section A owner.

No mocks. No out-of-lane edits beyond the two blocking packaging fixes (documented above).
